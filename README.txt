| Rewiner is a launcher for Rewinder (https://rewinder.fun) that       |
| associates the austiblox:// protocol and sets everything up to       |
| mostly work out of the box.                                          |
|                                                                      |
| It's a very simple group of shell scripts that help install and      |
| play Rewinder on your Linux (maybe BSD?) system.                     |
|                                                                      |
| Clients below 2014 work BUT you might need to change your X.org      |
| driver.                                                              |
|                                                                      |
| You might also need to run "winetricks --self-update" with sudo/root |
| to grab the latest version of winetricks directly from the           |
| developers of it.                                                    |
