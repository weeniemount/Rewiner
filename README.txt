| AustiWine is a launcher for Austiblox (https://austiblox.net/) so it |
| runs on Wine.                                                        |
|                                                                      |
| It's a very simple group of shell scripts that help install and      |
| launch Austiblox on your Linux (maybe BSD?) system.                  |
|                                                                      |
| Only 2014+ clients work.                                             |
|                                                                      |
| You might also need to run "winetricks --self-update" with sudo/root |
| to grab the latest version of winetricks directly from the           |
| developers of it.                                                    |
